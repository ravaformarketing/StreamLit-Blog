Matt Barker,LinkedIn Post,"7 months ago when I started using LinkedIn, I earned ¬£200/month and felt depressed seeing other freelancers succeeding.

- I thought I was a failure
- I thought I made a huge mistake
- I thought everyone was better than me

Because all I saw on LinkedIn was people succeeding.

If you scroll your LinkedIn feed right now, you will see 1/+ of the below:

- A post celebrating personal success
- A posed selfie in front of a car or a stupid flower wall
- A brag about how much money they have made this month

That is all well and good if you're doing well.

But if you are finding your feet? It sucks.

So to change the pattern of depression, try this:

Honesty posts.

Promote the REAL side of being a freelancer. Or a solopreneur. Or life in general.

It isn't perfect and it's full of ups and downs.

I am all for celebrating success, but celebrate your failures too.

That's why I try to speak regularly about things I struggle with now or in the past.

Nobody is too small to influence change.

P.S. is there anything you think I don't talk about that you want to hear more of?"

Justin Welsh,LinkedIn Post,"A few controversial things I believe about Solopreneurship.

1) It's not as difficult as you think.

I‚Äôm not saying it's easy to start building your own business.

I‚Äôm just saying that the core fundamentals are some knowledge, a landing page, a way to collect a payment, and the courage to talk about it daily.

-

2) You don't need to work 60-80 hours per week

Contrary to popular belief, the 24/7 successful hustle bro is a myth.

I've seen it firsthand.

- Burnout
- Fake riches
- Happy outside, sh  * tty inside.

Hustling is necessary sometimes.

Hustle 24/7 is a fast track to misery.

-

3) You don't need to be ruthless or transactional

99% of the time, acting this way is a giant mistake.

Instead, try these things, which allow you to be successful without being an a  *   * hole.

- Build a tight circle of real friends
- Provide value daily to each other and others
- Help them achieve their goals and grow together

Recognize who helped you get there and say yes to those folks often.

When someone doesn't make an effort to build a real relationship, say a polite ""no"".

You can't be everything to everyone, but you don't have to be a jerk either.

-

4) Money matters, but it's not the ""be-all, end-all"".

Pursuing as much money as possible is a silly goal.

Because money doesn't create joy.

It can certainly be helpful in creating many, many moments of fleeting happiness, but a happy life isn't what I'm after.

My pursuit in life is about joy:

- Having purpose
- Having community
- Helping other people

You can do all of that without $10M or $50M or $100M.

-

I hope this helps dispel a few myths about building a one-person business.

There's never been a better time to get started.

Why not now? Why not you?"

(‚úîÔ∏è Tick the ones you have as well)

‚ñ¢ Minimalism
They only show their very best work. They know clients are too busy to look at dozens of pieces.

‚ñ¢ Authentic ""About Me""
Humans prefer to hire humans. So they make themselves approachable through their personal story.

‚ñ¢ Clear services
They explain EXACTLY how they help their clients.
Clarity = Conversions.

‚ñ¢ Elaborated case studies
They know that clients hire them because of their thinking process, not just their results.

‚ñ¢ Diverse social proof
Anything can be faked, so they combine different types of social proof to show they're legit.
For example, video testimonials + client logos + social media comments.

‚ñ¢ Smart UX
Their websites are easy to navigate, and they use UX methods that make clients spend more time looking at their work.

‚ñ¢ Blogs
They create content about their craft to position themselves as experts and build alternative revenue streams.

‚ñ¢ Easy to reach
They write strong call-to-actions and have easy ways to get in touch with them through different platforms.

For example, Calendly link/Email/WhatsApp number/DMs.

‚ñ¢ Visual identity
They use consistent fonts and colors that make them recognizable.

Gary Vaynerchuk,LinkedIn Post,"Most new managers think that becoming a manager is the ‚Äúgraduation.‚Äù Truth is, it‚Äôs the reverse.

When you go from being someone who ‚Äúexecutes‚Äù to someone who‚Äôs managing a team, you go from trading on IQ to trading on EQ. 

You go from doing the actual work to listening to employees, catering to what they want, taking blame, and being the bigger person.

Remember, leaders work for their employees."
Gary Vaynerchuk,LinkedIn Post,"The best leaders and CEOs are empathetic.

Why? They understand that it‚Äôs about more than being a caring person, it‚Äôs about taking your understanding of another person or group of people and using it to create a win-win scenario.

It‚Äôs also important to balance empathy with letting people learn things on their own, especially in a business context.

For example, when two of my employees have a disagreement or conflict, I might intuitively know the answers to what would improve or fix the situation. That being said, I still want to give them the opportunity to figure it out for themselves."
Gary Vaynerchuk,LinkedIn Post,"If you're 22, 25, 30, and you think you should have your whole career path figured out, that's ludicrous.

Richard van der Blom,LinkedIn Post,"10 Brutal Truths About Why LinkedIn Isn‚Äôt Working for You
and for 95% of Members who still don't have a Winning Action Plan 

LinkedIn promises to be a goldmine for professionals, but the harsh reality is that it simply doesn‚Äôt work for 95% of its members. Why? Because most are making the same fatal mistakes that make all their hard work useless. 

Ready for some tough love? 

1. Desperate Pleas for Success: Your profile screams desperation. Statements like ""I need to make this work really fast now"" or ""I almost run out of money, I need a quick fix"" repel potential success. Confidence, not desperation, is key.
 
2. No Repeat Business: If you‚Äôre not getting any offline referrals or repeat clients, it‚Äôs a clear sign you‚Äôre not providing enough value. LinkedIn can‚Äôt save a bad business model.

3. Generic Profile: Your profile looks like everyone else's. No unique selling proposition, no compelling story. Just another face in the crowd.

4. Poor Networking Etiquette: You‚Äôre treating LinkedIn like a numbers game, adding connections without engaging meaningfully. Networking is about relationships, not numbers.

5. Inconsistent Activity: Posting once in a blue moon won‚Äôt cut it. Consistency builds visibility and trust. If you‚Äôre not showing up regularly, you‚Äôre already forgotten.

6. Spammy DMs: Sending generic, copy-pasted messages to potential leads is a surefire way to get ignored. Personalize your outreach, or don‚Äôt bother.

7. Lack of Value: If your content isn‚Äôt providing value, you‚Äôre wasting your time. No one wants to read posts that don‚Äôt educate, entertain, or inspire.

8. Overly Formal Tone: LinkedIn is professional, but it doesn‚Äôt mean you should be robotic. Show some personality and make genuine connections.
 
9. Not Allocating Time: You think LinkedIn is a quick fix, but it's not. If you‚Äôre not willing to allocate time to it, it shows it‚Äôs not a priority for you. Building trust and credibility takes time and consistent effort.
 
10. Lack of Clear Call to Action: If you‚Äôre not guiding your audience on what to do next, they‚Äôll do nothing. Always include a clear call to action in your posts and messages.

1. Optimize Your Profile: Your profile should be a magnet, not a repellent. Invest time in a professional visuals, a compelling headline, and a powerful summary.
2. Showcase Your Expertise: Publish articles, share industry insights, and give away some of your best advice for free. Make people see you as a go-to resource.
3. Engage Like Crazy: Comment thoughtfully on other posts, join groups, and participate in discussions. The more visible you are, the more connections you'll make.
4. Leverage Recommendations: Ask for and give recommendations. They're the LinkedIn equivalent of gold stars and help build credibility.
5. Personalize Your Outreach: When connecting, send a personalized note explaining why you want to connect. Make it about them, not you.

Remember, LinkedIn is not a magic lead wand. It's a tool. Use it wisely, and you might just turn those crickets into cash.

Richard van der Blom,LinkedIn Post,"THOUGHT LEADERSHIP IS DEAD! 

Or at least, the term is on life support, hijacked by coaches, C-level execs and business owners who think optimizing their profiles in 30 minutes and churning out three posts a week qualifies them as ""thought leaders."" It doesn't.

Fact Check:
Thought Leadership isn't just a trendy buzzword; it‚Äôs a profound responsibility. 

According to Forbes, 
""Thought leaders are the informed opinion leaders and the go-to people in their field of expertise. They are trusted sources who move and inspire people with innovative ideas; turn ideas into reality, and know and show how to replicate their success.""

True Thought Leadership is about igniting minds and enlightening communities. It's about more than just sharing expertise‚Äîit's about motivating, guiding, and inspiring people to take meaningful action. True thought leaders build a trusted follower base, not through flashy posts but through genuine, consistent engagement and impactful insights.

Here's how real Thought Leaders differ from the impostors:

- ùóßùóµùó≤ùòÜ ùó†ùóºùòÅùó∂ùòÉùóÆùòÅùó≤: They push others to strive for greatness, not just within their industry but within their personal growth.
- ùóßùóµùó≤ùòÜ ùóöùòÇùó∂ùó±ùó≤: They provide actionable advice and support, helping others navigate their professional paths.
- ùóßùóµùó≤ùòÜ ùóúùóªùòÄùóΩùó∂ùóøùó≤: Their words and actions lead to transformative changes and innovations.
- ùóßùóµùó≤ùòÜ ùóïùòÇùó∂ùóπùó± ùóßùóøùòÇùòÄùòÅ: They cultivate a community that values their insights and follows their lead, not out of obligation but out of genuine respect and trust.

Look at the image below. Thought Leadership is the spark that ignites the fire of enlightenment. It's about lighting the way for others, not just highlighting oneself.

And all the others?
They might be experts,
They might be brand ambassadors
But Thought Leader is something you need to earn

Here's why this kind of consistency is your golden ticket to LinkedIn success:

1. Creativity Rules: Stop being a content robot. It's not about churning out posts but crafting ones that stand out and resonate.
2. Find your Own Tone of Voice: highlighting successes or approaches from other creators? It may seem cool, but doesn't lead to positioning yourself.
3. Step Up Your Game: Always look for ways to improve. The same old strategies won't get you new results. Challenge yourself to innovate.

3. The Non-Payer: Always has a reason why this month‚Äôs payment is delayed. Spoiler: it never gets better.
4. The Scope Creeper: Constantly asking for ""just one more thing""‚Äîwithout ever wanting to pay for the extra work.
5. The Indecisive: Changes their mind more often than their socks, causing endless revisions and headaches.
6. The Abuser: Thinks that because they pay you, they own you. Hint: they don't.
7. The Know-It-All: Hired you for your expertise but insists they know better. Why did they hire you again?
8. The Freebie Seeker: Always pushing for discounts, freebies, and ""just a little help"" on the side.
9. The Mismatched Values: Their business practices or values clash with yours, making every interaction uncomfortable.

Laugh, cringe, or maybe even cry a little. But seriously, it's time to re-evaluate. Bad clients don‚Äôt just drain your energy‚Äîthey can also drag your business down.
Remember they should pay you for your unique expertise, not to manage you!

Peter Sorgenfrei,LinkedIn Post,"üí∞ How Startup Funding Works
+The Emotional Phases and Ways to Deal With Them

Raising funds and pitching to investors is all about answering:

What does the company do?
What makes it special/unique in some way?
Why is now the time to launch/scale it?
What will it take to succeed?
How big can it grow?
Who are you and your co-founders?

Sounds simple enough.

But for every pitch, every stage, every round, every rejection, and every success‚Ä¶

There is an emotional rollercoaster that founders need to go through.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Anxiety
It‚Äôs easy to get overwhelmed by the 100 things you need to do before you pitch. Anxiety can creep in when you don‚Äôt have anyone else to rely on with these things. Get someone you trust to help you.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Exhilaration
It‚Äôs good to get excited when meeting investors. But don‚Äôt expect them to be on board right away. It‚Äôll take more than a few meetings to successfully convince an investor.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Disappointment
It‚Äôs always hard to find out they‚Äôre not interested to invest. Don‚Äôt take it personally. Sometimes, the fund and your startup were just not a good fit. Always call to ask why they rejected you.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Hope
All it takes is one to say yes. So you keep moving from one investor to the next. But also remember to nurture and build these relationships. You never know when they could help you in the future.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Optimism
There‚Äôs nothing quite like closing a round and holding that term sheet ready to be signed. But don't jump the gun and spend on offices and new hires without it being a done deal. Also, remember the money is only there to help you grow; you still need to do the hard work to get it done right.

My advice üëâ Before you go raise money, please make sure you have:
‚úî Love at home.
‚úî Good health and lifestyle.
‚úî Time to do what matters most.

Compared to love, health, and time, money has very limited value.

Peter Sorgenfrei,LinkedIn Post,"Don't water dead plants. 
 
This idea might seem obvious in your house, but for some reason, many people continue doing it in their businesses. 
 
Of course, you realize that I‚Äôm not literally talking about plants, but rather elements of your company that it‚Äôs time to say goodbye to. 
 
Most of us are aware of the fallacy of sunk cost, a cognitive bias that occurs when people make decisions based on the amount of time, money, or resources they have already invested in a particular endeavor, rather than considering the current circumstances and future prospects. 
 
The fallacy is that we believe that because we have already invested significant resources in something, we should continue doing it to justify or recoup our initial investment, even if it no longer makes rational sense to do so. 
 
But to do so is to look at the past rather than the future. 
 
In my work with CEOs, I‚Äôve seen two types of dead plants that continue to get watered. 
 
First, there are people. I‚Äôve always believed you should hire slowly and fire quickly. 
 
Harsh? Not really. If you‚Äôve done all you can to help improve a poor performer, it‚Äôs time to let them go - for your sake and theirs. 
 
If you allow incompetence to exist in your company, it quickly becomes noticed - and others think it‚Äôs acceptable. Nip it in the bud. 
 
The second dead plant I‚Äôve seen are ideas. We have a (natural!) tendency to fall in love with our own ideas and hold onto them with a death grip. 
 
But prying yourself loose from ideas whose time has passed is incredibly liberating and will open your mind to new possibilities. 
 
Sometimes, you just need some new plants."
Peter Sorgenfrei,LinkedIn Post,"When I‚Äôm at my best, 50% of my time is unscheduled.‚Äù - Steve Jobs

Phase 1Ô∏è‚É£: Build a great product people love
Phase 2Ô∏è‚É£: Scale by delegation
Phase 3Ô∏è‚É£: Maximize profits

The second phase is arguably the hardest one for a leader.
It‚Äôs where the most confusion and friction occurs.

Once a company has over 20-30 employees, a CEO must transition from a doer to a leader.

And the best way to do that is through Purpose and Alignment.

You need to be able to define and codify your Mission, Strategy, and Metrics in a way that‚Äôs clear, simple, and inspiring.

Your mission should feel ambitious and permanent.
Your product strategy and GTM strategy should be relevant and updated.
Your metrics should be directly actionable and drives top-line business results.

Now, going back to what Steve Jobs said‚Ä¶

In order to clearly define these things, you need to take a step back.

üöß Series A

At this stage, you need a reliable, predictable way of pouring money into customer acquisition. You need an effective go-to-market strategy that can capture your ideal customer segments. 

üöß Series B

From this point onwards, it‚Äôs going to be a high-speed race. A race to capture the most share in the market against bigger competitors. Are you able to expand, scale, and grow to optimize your target market?

üöß Series C+

This is where founders are tested and turned into strong leaders. Are you able to build a startup culture that can support hundreds of employees? Are you able to maintain the core values you had when there were only a handful in the startup? 

As you move up the fundraising stages, you'll discover the new risks that come with growing your startup.

What most founders realize (sometimes too late) is that they can‚Äôt do it alone.

You need a mentor or advisor to help you successfully navigate your startup journey.

Strategies from Facebook, Airbnb, Uber, Slack, and Instagram.

Reading up on Y Combinator, I found out they have:
Funded over 3,500 startups.
With a combined valuation nearing $1T.
And they nurture a community of over 9,000 founders.

I found their amazing guide for founders looking to set up a growth strategy and team.

It covers:
üîπ When to invest in growth
üîπ Good retention & bad retention
üîπ When to hire your initial growth team
üîπ Your growth team's first year
üîπ Where should the growth team sit?

It‚Äôs a great read for startups in the early stage looking to scale.

Here‚Äôs my advice for building teams like these:

üí° Consistency
Empower your team with the systems to consistently deliver results.

üí° Resiliency
Instill the mindset to find a way even when things don‚Äôt go their way.

üí° Vibrancy
Encourage your team to be intentional and helpful in how they communicate and work well with each other.

I believe these three things are what make a successful team.

Peter Sorgenfrei,LinkedIn Post,"üìà The Founder‚Äôs Journey üìâ

Most founders dream of building a 7 to 8-figure business.
Only to find out that they‚Äôre stuck.
No time. No money. No life.

üëâ The hard truth for most successful founders is that they had to sacrifice a great deal to take their ventures to the next level. 

Building a company is a lot like surfing. üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
You need to practice a lot to succeed.
You will certainly fall down A LOT.
Until the magic happens.

The wave, the timing, and the balance are just right.
Once your company succeeds, it‚Äôs like nothing you‚Äôve ever experienced.
But getting there will always require a lot of falling down and getting back up.

‚ö† This is mostly because founders find themselves doing almost everything.

It‚Äôs easy to fall into the trap of wanting to do everything.
For most, it becomes a habit that‚Äôs hard to break.
So picking what you need to work on is key.

Why you need them and what to include ‚Üì

One of the top reasons startups fail is co-founder fallout.

Before you start any company with anyone, please have everything in writing.

It doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre your best friend(s).

They won‚Äôt be when you disagree on:
‚ö† Profit distribution
‚ö† Ownership percentages
‚ö† Decision-making authority

A founders‚Äô agreement can protect you and the business from crumbling in the future.

Here‚Äôs what you should include:
‚Ä¢ Roles and responsibilities to the company
‚Ä¢ Equity compensation and vesting
‚Ä¢ Salary and working schedule
‚Ä¢ Founder restrictions
‚Ä¢ Intellectual property, moral rights, and non-infringement
‚Ä¢ Confidential information
‚Ä¢ Data Protection
‚Ä¢ Termination and resignation

The key is to map out how the company is run and what actions you can take if a co-founder isn‚Äôt acting in the company‚Äôs best interests.

It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the excitement and hustle of starting a new venture.

That‚Äôs okay! But be sure to have safeguards in place in case anything happens.

Kevin Indig,LinkedIn Post,"Clients, podcasters and panel hosts often ask me what skills SEOs need to build for the AI future.

For a long time, my answer was to learn, stay open-minded and gain as much practical experience with AI as possible.

Now, my answer is SEOs should learn how to build AI agents and workflows that automate tasks across technical SEO, content generation and data analysis.

AI changes the way search works but also the way SEOs work."
Kevin Indig,LinkedIn Post,"üëëAI raises the value of human content

Context: Training data on the open web becomes increasingly scarce: a new paper shows the growing exclusion of AI crawlers from websites, especially newspapers, social networks and forums.

No wonder: LLM developers make licensing deals with publishers: they need more and fresh content to train new models.

ü§îIronically: licensing deals are much more lucrative than selling content directly to end consumers.

üëâüèªResult: human content becomes more valuable as training data for LLMs.

Nick Bennett,LinkedIn Post,"You're hosting another webinar. 
The chat's dead silent. 

Half your attendees are probably scrolling through their phones. And you can practically hear people dropping off like flies. 

Sound familiar? It's time to wake the hell up and revolutionize your webinar game.

I've been there. We've all been there. Boring, one-way presentations that put people to sleep faster than a bottle of NyQuil. But in 2024, if your webinars aren't engaging, interactive, and valuable as f*ck, you're wasting everyone's time - including your own.

Here are 5 ways to turn your webinars from snoozefests into can't-miss experiences:

1. Ditch the monologue: Stop talking AT people. Start conversations. Use real-time polls, Q&As, and breakout rooms. Get people involved or get out of the game.

2. Bring the energy: If you're not excited, why the hell should your audience be? Pump up the enthusiasm, use storytelling, and for God's sake, show some personality!

3. Less is more: Cut the fluff. Focus on ONE core message and drill it home. Give people actionable takeaways they can implement immediately.

4. Make it visual: Our brains are wired for visuals. Use dynamic slides, live demos, and even props. Anything to break up the monotony and keep eyes glued to the screen.

5. Create FOMO: Exclusive content, limited-time offers, or guest experts. Give people a reason to show up live instead of watching the recording (if you even offer one).

I remember when we overhauled our webinar strategy at VaynerMedia. We went from typical corporate snoozefests to high-energy, interactive experiences. Attendance shot up. Engagement went through the roof. And most importantly, our audience started getting real, tangible value.

Here's the thing: Webinars aren't just about delivering information. They're about creating experiences that stick with people. That inspire action. That make people feel like they're part of something bigger.

So here's my challenge to you: Take a hard look at your next webinar. Are you truly creating value? Are you engaging your audience in meaningful ways? Or are you just going through the motions?

It's time to step up or step out. The days of boring, one-way webinars are over. Your audience deserves better, and frankly, so do you.

What's one way you're going to make your next webinar more engaging? Drop it in the comments."

(Original post)

I'm going to stop posting on LinkedIn.

Because I feel like a jacka$$ for not having the bandwidth to reply thoughtfully to every comment.

I also feel bad that I don't engage with other's content as much yet they engage with mine.

Dividends on this platform are paid the highest when you support others, not just take from others.

Posting your own stuff without replying back to others, is selfish.

I'm forcing myself to take a month off from LI.

I haven't even been in the best mood and can feel myself nearing negativity.

When I don't feel positive, it isn't fair to write something uninspiring to the audience.

Being selfish on the feed isn't okay.

But drawing boundaries to protect your mental health, is okay.

Every single day, I get people rolling up in my DMs asking me for help.
People just take for granted that I have a business to run, that I'm a founder on 100% commissions and don't have the luxury to give up my time freely anymore.

My DMs are giving me massive anxiety.

And so I'm just going to stay away from LI altogether until my mental health is 100%.

I've helped so many people where it's now become an expectation and get mad that I say no.

Being taken for granted is the emotion that makes me the most bitter.

Not even 5% of the hundred of people, cared to even help me back when I needed it.

It's getting to a point where people don't even care to see how I am / if I need help.

I use to help absolutely anyone; friends, linkedin connections and even strangers with anything.

Now it's taking a toll on me.

Hundred of people have benefited from my immense help, free of charge. But I'm the one left with nothing but bad mental health.

I‚Äôve done SO many things for people outside of my business operations to help others get back on their feet, get paid and even start their own businesses.

People hardly appreciate it and even take it for granted, expecting me to do more of it.

Doing things out of kindness has literally ruined my mental health and stifled my business progress.

My people pleasing days have left the chat.

Signing off so I can be at my best, when I do return.

I don't care how many DMs I have.

I am putting me first."

EDIT: I didn't expect so many people to be interested, LET ME GET THROUGH MY DMS SOON.

Implementing some filters to make it easier for myself: 

1) You must be in the US or Canada (not outside of these regions)
2) You must sell to an ICP that isn't hard to learn or sell to (I am staying away from SDRs who sell to IT, Engineering, accounting, product managers -- the technical stuff)
3) You must carry a role as an SDR / full cycle AE by summer (whenever I start my mentorship)
