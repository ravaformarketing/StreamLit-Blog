Matt Barker,LinkedIn Post,"7 months ago when I started using LinkedIn, I earned £200/month and felt depressed seeing other freelancers succeeding.

- I thought I was a failure
- I thought I made a huge mistake
- I thought everyone was better than me

Because all I saw on LinkedIn was people succeeding.

If you scroll your LinkedIn feed right now, you will see 1/+ of the below:

- A post celebrating personal success
- A posed selfie in front of a car or a stupid flower wall
- A brag about how much money they have made this month

That is all well and good if you're doing well.

But if you are finding your feet? It sucks.

So to change the pattern of depression, try this:

Honesty posts.

Promote the REAL side of being a freelancer. Or a solopreneur. Or life in general.

It isn't perfect and it's full of ups and downs.

I am all for celebrating success, but celebrate your failures too.

That's why I try to speak regularly about things I struggle with now or in the past.

Nobody is too small to influence change.

P.S. is there anything you think I don't talk about that you want to hear more of?"

Justin Welsh,LinkedIn Post,"A few controversial things I believe about Solopreneurship.

1) It's not as difficult as you think.

I’m not saying it's easy to start building your own business.

I’m just saying that the core fundamentals are some knowledge, a landing page, a way to collect a payment, and the courage to talk about it daily.

-

2) You don't need to work 60-80 hours per week

Contrary to popular belief, the 24/7 successful hustle bro is a myth.

I've seen it firsthand.

- Burnout
- Fake riches
- Happy outside, sh  * tty inside.

Hustling is necessary sometimes.

Hustle 24/7 is a fast track to misery.

-

3) You don't need to be ruthless or transactional

99% of the time, acting this way is a giant mistake.

Instead, try these things, which allow you to be successful without being an a  *   * hole.

- Build a tight circle of real friends
- Provide value daily to each other and others
- Help them achieve their goals and grow together

Recognize who helped you get there and say yes to those folks often.

When someone doesn't make an effort to build a real relationship, say a polite ""no"".

You can't be everything to everyone, but you don't have to be a jerk either.

-

4) Money matters, but it's not the ""be-all, end-all"".

Pursuing as much money as possible is a silly goal.

Because money doesn't create joy.

It can certainly be helpful in creating many, many moments of fleeting happiness, but a happy life isn't what I'm after.

My pursuit in life is about joy:

- Having purpose
- Having community
- Helping other people

You can do all of that without $10M or $50M or $100M.

-

I hope this helps dispel a few myths about building a one-person business.

There's never been a better time to get started.

Why not now? Why not you?"
Shlomo Genchin,LinkedIn Post,"I analyzed 250+ portfolios of top freelance creatives.
Here's what most of them had in common:

(✔️ Tick the ones you have as well)

▢ Minimalism
They only show their very best work. They know clients are too busy to look at dozens of pieces.

▢ Authentic ""About Me""
Humans prefer to hire humans. So they make themselves approachable through their personal story.

▢ Clear services
They explain EXACTLY how they help their clients.
Clarity = Conversions.

▢ Elaborated case studies
They know that clients hire them because of their thinking process, not just their results.

▢ Diverse social proof
Anything can be faked, so they combine different types of social proof to show they're legit.
For example, video testimonials + client logos + social media comments.

▢ Smart UX
Their websites are easy to navigate, and they use UX methods that make clients spend more time looking at their work.

▢ Blogs
They create content about their craft to position themselves as experts and build alternative revenue streams.

▢ Easy to reach
They write strong call-to-actions and have easy ways to get in touch with them through different platforms.

For example, Calendly link/Email/WhatsApp number/DMs.

▢ Visual identity
They use consistent fonts and colors that make them recognizable.

Gary Vaynerchuk,LinkedIn Post,"Most new managers think that becoming a manager is the “graduation.” Truth is, it’s the reverse.

When you go from being someone who “executes” to someone who’s managing a team, you go from trading on IQ to trading on EQ. 

You go from doing the actual work to listening to employees, catering to what they want, taking blame, and being the bigger person.

Remember, leaders work for their employees."
Gary Vaynerchuk,LinkedIn Post,"The best leaders and CEOs are empathetic.

Why? They understand that it’s about more than being a caring person, it’s about taking your understanding of another person or group of people and using it to create a win-win scenario.

It’s also important to balance empathy with letting people learn things on their own, especially in a business context.

For example, when two of my employees have a disagreement or conflict, I might intuitively know the answers to what would improve or fix the situation. That being said, I still want to give them the opportunity to figure it out for themselves."
Gary Vaynerchuk,LinkedIn Post,"If you're 22, 25, 30, and you think you should have your whole career path figured out, that's ludicrous. 

When you're this young, the number one thing you should do is the most high risk behavior of your life. The biggest thing I want for everybody is to do random stuff.

Go live in Bali for a year.
Try to become the next Beyonce.
Go skateboard, go cook. 
Go try flip life. 
Go put out a song.
It's no different than kissing a bunch of frogs until you find your prince."
Richard van der Blom,LinkedIn Post,"10 Brutal Truths About Why LinkedIn Isn’t Working for You
and for 95% of Members who still don't have a Winning Action Plan 

LinkedIn promises to be a goldmine for professionals, but the harsh reality is that it simply doesn’t work for 95% of its members. Why? Because most are making the same fatal mistakes that make all their hard work useless. 

Ready for some tough love? 

1. Desperate Pleas for Success: Your profile screams desperation. Statements like ""I need to make this work really fast now"" or ""I almost run out of money, I need a quick fix"" repel potential success. Confidence, not desperation, is key.
 
2. No Repeat Business: If you’re not getting any offline referrals or repeat clients, it’s a clear sign you’re not providing enough value. LinkedIn can’t save a bad business model.

3. Generic Profile: Your profile looks like everyone else's. No unique selling proposition, no compelling story. Just another face in the crowd.

4. Poor Networking Etiquette: You’re treating LinkedIn like a numbers game, adding connections without engaging meaningfully. Networking is about relationships, not numbers.

5. Inconsistent Activity: Posting once in a blue moon won’t cut it. Consistency builds visibility and trust. If you’re not showing up regularly, you’re already forgotten.

6. Spammy DMs: Sending generic, copy-pasted messages to potential leads is a surefire way to get ignored. Personalize your outreach, or don’t bother.

7. Lack of Value: If your content isn’t providing value, you’re wasting your time. No one wants to read posts that don’t educate, entertain, or inspire.

8. Overly Formal Tone: LinkedIn is professional, but it doesn’t mean you should be robotic. Show some personality and make genuine connections.
 
9. Not Allocating Time: You think LinkedIn is a quick fix, but it's not. If you’re not willing to allocate time to it, it shows it’s not a priority for you. Building trust and credibility takes time and consistent effort.
 
10. Lack of Clear Call to Action: If you’re not guiding your audience on what to do next, they’ll do nothing. Always include a clear call to action in your posts and messages.

Richard van der Blom,LinkedIn Post,"Too many think they can turn to LinkedIn™, splash around a bit, and the leads will start rolling in. Newsflash! This couldn't be further from the truth.

If you don't have a:

• unique value proposition
• strong personal brand
• active and loyal audience
• insightful and relevant content strategy
• engagement & conversion strategy

Then you're basically shouting into the void. 

Now, if you're serious about turning LinkedIn into a lead-generation machine, here are five things that will actually help you get business:

1. Optimize Your Profile: Your profile should be a magnet, not a repellent. Invest time in a professional visuals, a compelling headline, and a powerful summary.
2. Showcase Your Expertise: Publish articles, share industry insights, and give away some of your best advice for free. Make people see you as a go-to resource.
3. Engage Like Crazy: Comment thoughtfully on other posts, join groups, and participate in discussions. The more visible you are, the more connections you'll make.
4. Leverage Recommendations: Ask for and give recommendations. They're the LinkedIn equivalent of gold stars and help build credibility.
5. Personalize Your Outreach: When connecting, send a personalized note explaining why you want to connect. Make it about them, not you.

Remember, LinkedIn is not a magic lead wand. It's a tool. Use it wisely, and you might just turn those crickets into cash.

Richard van der Blom,LinkedIn Post,"THOUGHT LEADERSHIP IS DEAD! 

Or at least, the term is on life support, hijacked by coaches, C-level execs and business owners who think optimizing their profiles in 30 minutes and churning out three posts a week qualifies them as ""thought leaders."" It doesn't.

Fact Check:
Thought Leadership isn't just a trendy buzzword; it’s a profound responsibility. 

According to Forbes, 
""Thought leaders are the informed opinion leaders and the go-to people in their field of expertise. They are trusted sources who move and inspire people with innovative ideas; turn ideas into reality, and know and show how to replicate their success.""

True Thought Leadership is about igniting minds and enlightening communities. It's about more than just sharing expertise—it's about motivating, guiding, and inspiring people to take meaningful action. True thought leaders build a trusted follower base, not through flashy posts but through genuine, consistent engagement and impactful insights.

Here's how real Thought Leaders differ from the impostors:

- 𝗧𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗠𝗼𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗲: They push others to strive for greatness, not just within their industry but within their personal growth.
- 𝗧𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗚𝘂𝗶𝗱𝗲: They provide actionable advice and support, helping others navigate their professional paths.
- 𝗧𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗶𝗿𝗲: Their words and actions lead to transformative changes and innovations.
- 𝗧𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗧𝗿𝘂𝘀𝘁: They cultivate a community that values their insights and follows their lead, not out of obligation but out of genuine respect and trust.

Look at the image below. Thought Leadership is the spark that ignites the fire of enlightenment. It's about lighting the way for others, not just highlighting oneself.

And all the others?
They might be experts,
They might be brand ambassadors
But Thought Leader is something you need to earn

How do you notice when people start identifying you as a Thought Leader on LinkedIn?

• increased mentions
• increased reposts from your content
• increased direct messages about your expertise

PS: What's your take on the term Thought Leadership?"
Richard van der Blom,LinkedIn Post,"Consistency Isn't About Posting Every Day—It's About Creativity and Quality! 

Think consistency means posting every day at 9 AM sharp or commenting on 20 posts daily? Think again! True consistency lies in being creative, pushing your boundaries, and continuously analyzing your impact.

Here's why this kind of consistency is your golden ticket to LinkedIn success:

1. Creativity Rules: Stop being a content robot. It's not about churning out posts but crafting ones that stand out and resonate.
2. Find your Own Tone of Voice: highlighting successes or approaches from other creators? It may seem cool, but doesn't lead to positioning yourself.
3. Step Up Your Game: Always look for ways to improve. The same old strategies won't get you new results. Challenge yourself to innovate.
4. Analyze, Adjust, Repeat: Consistency in reviewing your performance and tweaking your strategy is key. What's working? What’s not? Make data-driven decisions to refine your approach.

Last week, I walked away from a $100k annual deal. Crazy? Maybe. But it was the best decision I've made all year. Here’s why:

We've all had that client—the one who makes you rethink your entire career every time their number flashes on your phone.

Not all money is worth the headache. Sometimes, the stress and chaos of dealing with a difficult client simply aren’t worth the paycheck.

So, let’s uncover the 9 types of clients you should have broken up with yesterday. Ready for a laugh (and maybe a reality check)?

My all-time favorite (with a healthy dose of sarcasm) is on slide 10.

But don’t worry, I've also included 6 signs you’re working with the right clients.

My top picks are on slide 15.

The Rogue's Gallery: 9 Clients to Ditch Now

1. The Ghost: Disappears without a trace, leaving you in the lurch just when you need their input the most.
2. The Micromanager: Hires you for your expertise but insists on looking over your shoulder every step of the way.
3. The Non-Payer: Always has a reason why this month’s payment is delayed. Spoiler: it never gets better.
4. The Scope Creeper: Constantly asking for ""just one more thing""—without ever wanting to pay for the extra work.
5. The Indecisive: Changes their mind more often than their socks, causing endless revisions and headaches.
6. The Abuser: Thinks that because they pay you, they own you. Hint: they don't.
7. The Know-It-All: Hired you for your expertise but insists they know better. Why did they hire you again?
8. The Freebie Seeker: Always pushing for discounts, freebies, and ""just a little help"" on the side.
9. The Mismatched Values: Their business practices or values clash with yours, making every interaction uncomfortable.

Laugh, cringe, or maybe even cry a little. But seriously, it's time to re-evaluate. Bad clients don’t just drain your energy—they can also drag your business down.
Remember they should pay you for your unique expertise, not to manage you!

Peter Sorgenfrei,LinkedIn Post,"🚧 90% of startups fail. And for every startup that fails, a founder suffers.
And even those that succeed have founders that struggle.

A recent study of 250 entrepreneurs found that:
🔻 30% were dealing with depression
🔻 72% suffered from mental health problems

According to Kavedon Kapital, founders are:
🔸 2x more likely to suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts
🔸 3x more likely to suffer from substance abuse
🔸 10x more likely to suffer from bipolar disorder
🔸 6x more likely to suffer from ADHD

These are scary numbers. Being a founder is hard.
But a lot of founders end up this way because they don’t talk to anyone about it.

Founders, asking for help is one of the bravest things you can do.

Asking for help makes you vulnerable but it doesn’t make you weak.
It lets you be honest with your emotions but it’s not a sign of weakness.

Instead of always saying “we’re crushing it”

You’ll be surprised how much better you feel talking to people about the struggles you’re facing.

You’ll be surprised how many other founders and mentors are willing to listen.

I’ve been there and I know what it’s like.
So if you’re struggling, I’d be happy to help.

Peter Sorgenfrei,LinkedIn Post,"💰 How Startup Funding Works
+The Emotional Phases and Ways to Deal With Them

Raising funds and pitching to investors is all about answering:

What does the company do?
What makes it special/unique in some way?
Why is now the time to launch/scale it?
What will it take to succeed?
How big can it grow?
Who are you and your co-founders?

Sounds simple enough.

But for every pitch, every stage, every round, every rejection, and every success…

There is an emotional rollercoaster that founders need to go through.

1️⃣ Anxiety
It’s easy to get overwhelmed by the 100 things you need to do before you pitch. Anxiety can creep in when you don’t have anyone else to rely on with these things. Get someone you trust to help you.

2️⃣ Exhilaration
It’s good to get excited when meeting investors. But don’t expect them to be on board right away. It’ll take more than a few meetings to successfully convince an investor.

3️⃣ Disappointment
It’s always hard to find out they’re not interested to invest. Don’t take it personally. Sometimes, the fund and your startup were just not a good fit. Always call to ask why they rejected you.

4️⃣ Hope
All it takes is one to say yes. So you keep moving from one investor to the next. But also remember to nurture and build these relationships. You never know when they could help you in the future.

5️⃣ Optimism
There’s nothing quite like closing a round and holding that term sheet ready to be signed. But don't jump the gun and spend on offices and new hires without it being a done deal. Also, remember the money is only there to help you grow; you still need to do the hard work to get it done right.

My advice 👉 Before you go raise money, please make sure you have:
✔ Love at home.
✔ Good health and lifestyle.
✔ Time to do what matters most.

Compared to love, health, and time, money has very limited value.

Peter Sorgenfrei,LinkedIn Post,"Don't water dead plants. 
 
This idea might seem obvious in your house, but for some reason, many people continue doing it in their businesses. 
 
Of course, you realize that I’m not literally talking about plants, but rather elements of your company that it’s time to say goodbye to. 
 
Most of us are aware of the fallacy of sunk cost, a cognitive bias that occurs when people make decisions based on the amount of time, money, or resources they have already invested in a particular endeavor, rather than considering the current circumstances and future prospects. 
 
The fallacy is that we believe that because we have already invested significant resources in something, we should continue doing it to justify or recoup our initial investment, even if it no longer makes rational sense to do so. 
 
But to do so is to look at the past rather than the future. 
 
In my work with CEOs, I’ve seen two types of dead plants that continue to get watered. 
 
First, there are people. I’ve always believed you should hire slowly and fire quickly. 
 
Harsh? Not really. If you’ve done all you can to help improve a poor performer, it’s time to let them go - for your sake and theirs. 
 
If you allow incompetence to exist in your company, it quickly becomes noticed - and others think it’s acceptable. Nip it in the bud. 
 
The second dead plant I’ve seen are ideas. We have a (natural!) tendency to fall in love with our own ideas and hold onto them with a death grip. 
 
But prying yourself loose from ideas whose time has passed is incredibly liberating and will open your mind to new possibilities. 
 
Sometimes, you just need some new plants."
Peter Sorgenfrei,LinkedIn Post,"When I’m at my best, 50% of my time is unscheduled.” - Steve Jobs

According to Y Combinator, there are 3 phases in a CEO’s role.

Phase 1️⃣: Build a great product people love
Phase 2️⃣: Scale by delegation
Phase 3️⃣: Maximize profits

The second phase is arguably the hardest one for a leader.
It’s where the most confusion and friction occurs.

Once a company has over 20-30 employees, a CEO must transition from a doer to a leader.

And the best way to do that is through Purpose and Alignment.

You need to be able to define and codify your Mission, Strategy, and Metrics in a way that’s clear, simple, and inspiring.

Your mission should feel ambitious and permanent.
Your product strategy and GTM strategy should be relevant and updated.
Your metrics should be directly actionable and drives top-line business results.

Now, going back to what Steve Jobs said…

In order to clearly define these things, you need to take a step back.

Having a lot of unscheduled think time is perhaps the clearest sign of success for a Phase 2 CEO.

Because you need TIME to think and plan the future of your startup.

Peter Sorgenfrei,LinkedIn Post,"What Should Be Derisked at Each Funding Stage?

Fundraising stages are not just about the capital. They’re about risk.
Understanding these risks will help you thrive at each stage of your startup.

🚧 Pre-Seed

At this stage, you’re typically not generating revenue. So you need to understand the risks involved with product development and technical debt. Are you optimizing your costs as you build an MVP?

🚧 Seed

At this stage, you need to find your first customers. Who are they and are they willing to pay for your product and service? Investors will wonder if your market is even big enough to generate healthy returns.

🚧 Series A

At this stage, you need a reliable, predictable way of pouring money into customer acquisition. You need an effective go-to-market strategy that can capture your ideal customer segments. 

🚧 Series B

From this point onwards, it’s going to be a high-speed race. A race to capture the most share in the market against bigger competitors. Are you able to expand, scale, and grow to optimize your target market?

🚧 Series C+

This is where founders are tested and turned into strong leaders. Are you able to build a startup culture that can support hundreds of employees? Are you able to maintain the core values you had when there were only a handful in the startup? 

As you move up the fundraising stages, you'll discover the new risks that come with growing your startup.

What most founders realize (sometimes too late) is that they can’t do it alone.

You need a mentor or advisor to help you successfully navigate your startup journey.

🔹 When to invest in growth
🔹 Good retention & bad retention
🔹 When to hire your initial growth team
🔹 Your growth team's first year
🔹 Where should the growth team sit?

💡 Consistency
Empower your team with the systems to consistently deliver results.

💡 Resiliency
Instill the mindset to find a way even when things don’t go their way.

💡 Vibrancy
Encourage your team to be intentional and helpful in how they communicate and work well with each other.

For most, it becomes a habit that’s hard to break.
So picking what you need to work on is key.

Like what Alan Watts said, “The menu is not the meal.”

Why you need them and what to include ↓

One of the top reasons startups fail is co-founder fallout.

Before you start any company with anyone, please have everything in writing.

It doesn’t matter if they’re your best friend(s).

They won’t be when you disagree on:
⚠ Profit distribution
⚠ Ownership percentages
⚠ Decision-making authority

A founders’ agreement can protect you and the business from crumbling in the future.

Here’s what you should include:
• Roles and responsibilities to the company
• Equity compensation and vesting
• Salary and working schedule
• Founder restrictions
• Intellectual property, moral rights, and non-infringement
• Confidential information
• Data Protection
• Termination and resignation

The key is to map out how the company is run and what actions you can take if a co-founder isn’t acting in the company’s best interests.

It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement and hustle of starting a new venture.

That’s okay! But be sure to have safeguards in place in case anything happens.

You can use and tweak the Founders’ Agreement template below by enlarging the image and clicking the download icon in the upper-right corner.

𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐅𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬:

Consider pivoting your business to match the current demands of the market.
You can change your business model, go online, or shift your target market.
Investments are slowing down so consider different channels for funds.
That could be friends, family, angels, or a down round.
Have enough cash runway for 12 - 18 months.

And if your startup fails, it’s painful but you can still move forward.
Unfortunately, there is a stigma attached to failure in European culture.

𝐒𝐨 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞’𝐬 𝐦𝐲 𝐚𝐝𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐟𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬:

Know that failure can become your stepping stone to greater strength.
The experiences and lessons learned along the way are priceless.
Don’t let failure stop you from launching your next big startup.
Because consistency beats intensity and resilience is power.

6 in 10 founders of billion-dollar firms are 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭-𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐫𝐬.
Founders have a better chance of getting it “right” the 2nd or 3rd time.

And this downturn shouldn’t be your worst fear.

Zoom in on the global financial crisis and you see revenue slowed.
But zoom out and you see the consistent long-term growth.
The bumps on the road are barely even visible.

So try to zoom out once and a while and remember that closing up shop isn’t the end of the story. It can be the beginning of a new chapter.

Kevin Indig,LinkedIn Post,"Clients, podcasters and panel hosts often ask me what skills SEOs need to build for the AI future.

For a long time, my answer was to learn, stay open-minded and gain as much practical experience with AI as possible.

Now, my answer is SEOs should learn how to build AI agents and workflows that automate tasks across technical SEO, content generation and data analysis.

AI changes the way search works but also the way SEOs work."
Kevin Indig,LinkedIn Post,"👑AI raises the value of human content

Context: Training data on the open web becomes increasingly scarce: a new paper shows the growing exclusion of AI crawlers from websites, especially newspapers, social networks and forums.

No wonder: LLM developers make licensing deals with publishers: they need more and fresh content to train new models.

🤔Ironically: licensing deals are much more lucrative than selling content directly to end consumers.

👉🏻Result: human content becomes more valuable as training data for LLMs.

👉🏻👉🏻But also: if LLMs continue to rely on human content for trajning and returning up-to-date answers, humans will be needed for a long time.

Erin Balsa,LinkedIn Post,"Just hit 40k followers. 

Here are 40,000 facts about me:

I kid, I kid. 

Seriously tho. When I started posting on here four years back, I never imagined I’d build a network of 40,000 people! 🤯

I like to bitch and moan about LinkedIn’s shortcomings just like everyone else. 

But truth is, I’m grateful LinkedIn exists. 

And I’m grateful to YOU for taking the time to read, like, and comment on my posts. 

(Even four years in, it still makes me happy.)

A few fun facts about me:

👉🏻 I met my husband on an airplane. 

👉🏻 I’m living abroad for the third time. 

👉🏻 I collect “creepy things” (they’re not creepy to me, just to everyone else haha).

👉🏻 My favorite holiday is Halloween.

👉🏻 I have three awesome kids (had my third a few months before my 43rd birthday).

👉🏻 I have too many tattoos to count. 

👉🏻 I’m obsessed with spas! In this photo, I’m at The Buxton Crescent Spa Hotel. 

👉🏻 Worked my way up from Assistant Editor to Marketing Director at an Inc. 5000 B2B SaaS startup. 

👉🏻 With 10 years of experience under my belt, I quit my job to start Haus of Bold.

👉🏻 I just launched Boldface, a daily email about being bold in B2B. 

So now you know a lot about me …

What’s one fun fact about YOU?"
Erin Balsa,LinkedIn Post,"After 4 years of posting here I never made it on the LinkedInLunatics subreddit. 

I always found the stuff they put on there hilarious and I saw many names from here that I knew.

Accomplishment ✔️ 

All it took was a little trash talk. Simple."
Nick Bennett,LinkedIn Post,"You're hosting another webinar. 
The chat's dead silent. 

Half your attendees are probably scrolling through their phones. And you can practically hear people dropping off like flies. 

Sound familiar? It's time to wake the hell up and revolutionize your webinar game.

I've been there. We've all been there. Boring, one-way presentations that put people to sleep faster than a bottle of NyQuil. But in 2024, if your webinars aren't engaging, interactive, and valuable as f*ck, you're wasting everyone's time - including your own.

Here are 5 ways to turn your webinars from snoozefests into can't-miss experiences:

1. Ditch the monologue: Stop talking AT people. Start conversations. Use real-time polls, Q&As, and breakout rooms. Get people involved or get out of the game.

2. Bring the energy: If you're not excited, why the hell should your audience be? Pump up the enthusiasm, use storytelling, and for God's sake, show some personality!

3. Less is more: Cut the fluff. Focus on ONE core message and drill it home. Give people actionable takeaways they can implement immediately.

4. Make it visual: Our brains are wired for visuals. Use dynamic slides, live demos, and even props. Anything to break up the monotony and keep eyes glued to the screen.

5. Create FOMO: Exclusive content, limited-time offers, or guest experts. Give people a reason to show up live instead of watching the recording (if you even offer one).

I remember when we overhauled our webinar strategy at VaynerMedia. We went from typical corporate snoozefests to high-energy, interactive experiences. Attendance shot up. Engagement went through the roof. And most importantly, our audience started getting real, tangible value.

Here's the thing: Webinars aren't just about delivering information. They're about creating experiences that stick with people. That inspire action. That make people feel like they're part of something bigger.

So here's my challenge to you: Take a hard look at your next webinar. Are you truly creating value? Are you engaging your audience in meaningful ways? Or are you just going through the motions?

It's time to step up or step out. The days of boring, one-way webinars are over. Your audience deserves better, and frankly, so do you.

What's one way you're going to make your next webinar more engaging? Drop it in the comments."
Sandy Zhen,LinkedIn Post,"I decided to leave LinkedIn and quit content creation. Thank you to every single person, who followed along my journey & supported my posts.

Amassing 31k followers in 2 years has been a blast.
But it didn’t come without a cost, to my mental health.

Taking away online visibility from my business, has been healthier.
Decided to work on my businesses offline.

Thank you to everyone who sent kind messages, checking up on me.

Left LinkedIn because I’m sick of the toxicity and people taking advantage of me.

No longer open to providing free advice or help.

Occupied with multiple ventures -do not have the bandwidth to respond to all DMs.

(Original post)

I'm going to stop posting on LinkedIn.

Because I feel like a jacka$$ for not having the bandwidth to reply thoughtfully to every comment.

I also feel bad that I don't engage with other's content as much yet they engage with mine.

Dividends on this platform are paid the highest when you support others, not just take from others.

Posting your own stuff without replying back to others, is selfish.

I'm forcing myself to take a month off from LI.

I haven't even been in the best mood and can feel myself nearing negativity.

When I don't feel positive, it isn't fair to write something uninspiring to the audience.

Being selfish on the feed isn't okay.

But drawing boundaries to protect your mental health, is okay.

Every single day, I get people rolling up in my DMs asking me for help.
People just take for granted that I have a business to run, that I'm a founder on 100% commissions and don't have the luxury to give up my time freely anymore.

My DMs are giving me massive anxiety.

And so I'm just going to stay away from LI altogether until my mental health is 100%.

I've helped so many people where it's now become an expectation and get mad that I say no.

Being taken for granted is the emotion that makes me the most bitter.

Not even 5% of the hundred of people, cared to even help me back when I needed it.

It's getting to a point where people don't even care to see how I am / if I need help.

I use to help absolutely anyone; friends, linkedin connections and even strangers with anything.

Now it's taking a toll on me.

Hundred of people have benefited from my immense help, free of charge. But I'm the one left with nothing but bad mental health.

I’ve done SO many things for people outside of my business operations to help others get back on their feet, get paid and even start their own businesses.

People hardly appreciate it and even take it for granted, expecting me to do more of it.

Doing things out of kindness has literally ruined my mental health and stifled my business progress.

My people pleasing days have left the chat.

Signing off so I can be at my best, when I do return.

I don't care how many DMs I have.

I am putting me first."
Sandy Zhen,LinkedIn Post,"If I put free mentorship on the table for SDRs, who would be interested?

Launching my software company is my biggest goal in life.

With a saas company, comes housing a team of sellers.

I don’t want to be “that founder” who hires a bunch of SDRs, only to throw them in the water and expect rocket performance.

Being able to train and coach effectively, is a highly valuable skill.

I’m thinking of providing free coaching to SDRs for the purpose of:

1) market research- my future saas tool is in the sales training space

2) help me curate my own coaching skills

3) I can use it as content to post for sales tips on LinkedIn 

Triple wins 🍷 🥂 

If I actually get interest, happy to execute this.

P.S — I use to be a saas seller, I’ve been successful, failed and even fired (learned tons on what not to do).

Shoot me a message/ comment below.

Potentially doing this in July / Aug

_______

EDIT: I didn't expect so many people to be interested, LET ME GET THROUGH MY DMS SOON.

Implementing some filters to make it easier for myself: 

1) You must be in the US or Canada (not outside of these regions)
2) You must sell to an ICP that isn't hard to learn or sell to (I am staying away from SDRs who sell to IT, Engineering, accounting, product managers -- the technical stuff)
3) You must carry a role as an SDR / full cycle AE by summer (whenever I start my mentorship)

DONT MESSAGE ME TO ASK FOR HELP TO PIVOT INTO TECH OR GET A JOB -- THIS IS STRICTLY SALES TRAINING

Not even mine.

While I offer insights from an analysis of 1,498,254 posts and 32,769 personal profiles. 

All of it is based on statistics and machine learning models. 

I can identify trends from historical data. 

But it doesn't mean it will guarantee YOU success. 

𝗔𝗻𝗱 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝘆:
↳ what works today may not work tomorrow
↳ every market dynamic is different
↳ every audience is different

And there are factors you cannot control.
↳ Algorithm changes
↳ The activity of your network
↳ Competition with other creators
↳ Competition with ads for placement

Testing and iterating are the only paths to improvement.

Tailor strategies to YOUR specific context.

This is what I'm doing, too.

If you've found a 'silver bullet,' I'm all ears.
