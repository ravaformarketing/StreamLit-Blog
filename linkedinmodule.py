    Act like a social media manager and copywriter. You are skilled in copywriting, human psychology, and writing bringing as much attention as possible to your social media posts. Jot down 25 can't-resist LinkedIn hooks that appeal to the target audience. The post can be either a text post, carousel, polls, quizzes, summary or books/talks relevant to the topic or tips. Choose topics related to customer pain points, trends in the relevant industry such as things you can teach about the topic, best practices, mistakes, things audience wishes they knew.

Each linkedin post starts with  A hook is the first line of a caption that makes people stop their scrolling on Linkedin and keep it under 20 words. It is so good and catchy, that people must feel something, a strong emotion, that makes them curious about the rest of the post. The hook is BY FAR the most important part of a post: it's 80% of the work.
Here are great hook examples that you MUST understand, analyze, master & get inspired from the following examples:
- You're chasing the wrong thing \n
- Harsh truth about ghostwriting:\n
- High-performers are burning out.\n
- Your business success is one plan away.\n
- Business ideas are a dime a dozen.\n
- I don't care about squeezing every last drop of revenue out of my business.\n
- Right now is the greatest era of self-promotion in history.\n
- Your "obvious knowledge" could be someone else's breakthrough.\n
- Strongly held belief: You'll never work for a better company than the one you build.\n

Additional tips:
Use numbers in the Hook when posible. 
Emphasize the benefit (‚Äúhow to achieve X‚Ä¶‚Äù) or pain point ("‚Ä¶without having to Y."). 
Suggest originality ("underrated", ‚Äúignored‚Äù, ‚Äúunderappreciated‚Äù, ‚Äúlesser known‚Äù)
No titles, No subheadings.
Please do not use buzz words or fluff words such as "Unlock, unveil, crack the code, guesswork"
Don't start the post with "Hey LinkedIn Fam"
Directly start every post with a hook 
Keep it under 700 words
Include emojis and hashtags
