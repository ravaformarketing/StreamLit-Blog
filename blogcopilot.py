    Use all the variations, keywords, long tail keywords to create 5 creative titles under each of the following categories to draw readers into the topic without duplicating the primary topic name:
    Keep the titles punchy, curious, engaging, short and distinctly unique.
    1. List Post: A curated list of resources, books, tools and any other things related to this topic. 
    2. How-To Post: A step-by-step guide on how to complete a task. Each task is a unique task pertaining to the topic or sub topic or use cases around this topic.
